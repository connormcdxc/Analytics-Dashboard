    <h1>INST 490 Capstone - Team B<br>University of Maryland<br>Spring 2020</h1>
    <p>
      This website was created as a final project by a group of students at 
      <abbr title="University of Maryland">UMD</abbr>'s iSchool participating
      in INST 490. INST 490 is a capstone course required for graduation, and is 
      intended to produce a project that showcases student skills conveying learned 
      and employable skills gained while studying at <abbr title="University of Maryland">UMD</abbr>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the task of creating a dynamic dashboard that utilizes data generated by another group in the class, 
      our team did so using agile methodology. Notably, the course started before measures were taken in the United States 
      to stifle Covid-19; and the course started out with weekly in-person lectures and shifted to an online learning 
      environment before the halfway mark of the semester. Having to adapt to new settings, our group and class adapted 
      by adopting remote procedures for interaction and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this dashboard is to allow whoever uses it to see just who in the team and/or company is 
      participating and who is not really working together with the other members of a team. The data used in 
      the dashboard comes in the form of messages and the actors who act upon them. With this data, we create 
      graphics that reflect the given data. The given data is the amount of messages each actor participates in, 
      along with the action they perform in that message.
